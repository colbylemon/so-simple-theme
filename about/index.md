excerpt: "About me, and this site."

This is my little place on the web. Because sometimes I get the urge to write something, and I want a place to put it. The something I write is likely to be geeky/obscure/techy, because that's pretty much me. But I'm not going to make any promises about what will show up here. If you want some semi-professional info about me, I'll point you at my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/colby-lemon-a899025).

In case you care, or were wondering, this site uses [Jekyll]("http://jekyllrb.com") with the [So Simple Theme]("https://mademistakes.com/work/so-simple-jekyll-theme/").
